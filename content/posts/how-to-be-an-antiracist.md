In light of recent events, we're switched books from Simon Sinek's Inifite Game to [Ibram X. Kendi's How To Be An Antiracist](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/how-to-be-an-antiracist-1).

Through our own discussions we realized that we have a lot to learn.

The author has been kind enough to create and share some [book club resources](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5913d00603596e07853ef761/t/5dc37dafd013963f1c034404/1573092786304/bookclubkit.ANTIRACIST.pdf) that you can find on [his site](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/).

Check out our [Book Club page](/book-club) for more info.
